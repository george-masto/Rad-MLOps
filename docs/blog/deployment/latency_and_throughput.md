# Latency and Throughput

When deploying a machine learning model for medical imaging, latency and throughput must be considered to ensure both performance and compliance. Medical imaging models often need to process large files quickly. When integrating a model into production code, it is good practice to benchmark the integrated solution to ensure it meets the required performance metrics for both single-image processing time.

## Example: Dockerized Brain MRI Tumor Detection Model

Let's consider a concrete example of latency and throughput benchmarking for a brain MRI tumor detection model packaged in a Docker container:

## Model Specifications:
- Task: Binary classification (tumor present/absent) and tumor segmentation
- Input: 3D MRI scans (256x256x128 voxels)
- Model Architecture: 3D U-Net implemented in PyTorch
- GPU: NVIDIA Tesla V100
- Docker Image: brain-mri-model:v1

## Latency Requirements:
- Single-scan processing time: < 10 seconds

## Throughput Goal:
- Process at least 300 scans per hour

## Docker Setup:
1. Ensure the Docker image is built with GPU support:
   ```Dockerfile
   FROM nvidia/cuda:11.0-base
   # ... (other Dockerfile instructions)
   ```

2. Run the Docker container with GPU access:
   ```bash
   docker run --gpus all -p 8080:8080 brain-mri-model:v1
   ```

## Benchmarking Process:

1. **Single-Scan Latency Test**:
   ```bash
   time curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"scan_path": "/path/to/test_brain_mri.nii"}' \
        http://localhost:8080/predict
   ```

   Result: real 0m7.823s

3. **Throughput Calculation**:
   ```python
   latency = 7.823  # seconds
   scans_per_hour = 3600 / latency
   print(f"Estimated throughput: {scans_per_hour:.0f} scans per hour")
   ```

   Result: Estimated throughput: 459 scans per hour

## Analysis:
- Single-scan latency (7.823s) meets the requirement of <10s.
- Estimated throughput (459 scans/hour) exceeds the goal of 300 scans/hour.

## Docker-specific Considerations:
1. **GPU Passthrough**: Ensure that Docker is configured to use the GPU. This might require installing the NVIDIA Container Toolkit.

2. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate CPU and memory limits in your Docker run command to ensure consistent performance:
   ```bash
   docker run --gpus all --cpus 4 --memory 16g -p 8080:8080 brain-mri-model:v1
   ```
3. **Docker Image Optimization**: Use multi-stage builds to keep the final image size small, which can improve container start-up time.

## Deployment Considerations:
- Ensure the production environment supports Docker with GPU acceleration.
- Implement a load balancer to distribute requests across multiple Docker containers for higher throughput.

By conducting these benchmarks and analyses on your Dockerized model, you can ensure that your deployed medical imaging ML model meets the required performance standards for clinical use, while benefiting from the portability and consistency that Docker provides.
