# Who We Are

We are a dynamic duo: a condensed matter physics PhD turned deep-learning medical imaging scientist, and an MD turned AI solutions architect. With over 10 years of combined industry experience, we aim to document our journey of implementing MLOps in medical imaging the right way.

# Mission

Our mission is to teach you how to deploy and monitor medical imaging ML models within regulated environments using MLOps best practices.

# Goals

1. Develop strategies for productionizing ML models in regulated environments, focusing on MLOps best practices.
2. Understand the do’s and don’ts of MLOps within various medical regulatory constraints (e.g., FDA, CE).
3. Identify and provide solutions to common roadblocks related to the CI/CD of ML solutions for medical imaging tasks.
4. Organize code snippets and scripts showcasing common libraries and tools used in medical imaging MLOps.
5. Share these learnings and tips with our community here!

# Key Concepts

1. Data Management
2. CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
3. Automated Testing
4. Model Training & Testing
5. Model Deployment
6. Model Monitoring
